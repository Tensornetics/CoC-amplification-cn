# CoC-amplification-cn
Chain-of-Custody Amplification Network

## Tensor Amplification Convolutional Network
This program allows for the amplification of tensor data streams through the use of a convolutional neural network. The network is customizable and can be trained on various data sets to optimize the amplification process. In addition, the program includes a data security module to ensure the integrity and chain of custody of the data stream.

Examples of how to use the program can be found in the examples directory. The network.rs file contains the main structure of the convolutional network, while the amplification_matrix.rs file implements the amplification functionality. The convolutional_layer.rs file contains the code for the customizable convolutional layers within the network. The data_security.rs file handles the secure processing and handling of the data stream. The data_interface.rs file includes functions for interacting with the input and output data of the network, and the data_visualization.rs file includes functions for visualizing the amplified data. The mod.rs file includes all of these modules and makes them available for use in the program.
